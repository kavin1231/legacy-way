Api (node) > frontend (React) > Deploy  > Devops

create pos system

firstly check node -v,npm -v

npm init

install dependencies

create index.js file

after that import the dependencies

initialize the app

import env

connect mogoose

backend create


check ng version for create frontend

ng new pos-system-client

ng serve

create frontend

buy servers

create aws account

create ec2

launch an instance

before connect to ec2 instance using ssh client ,I'm going to transfer pem file to windows to ubuntu using this scp C:\Users\kavin\Desktop\devops-api-key.pem linuxcode@192.xxx.x.xxx:/home/linuxcode/Desktop/DEVOPS/,

open terminal located in pem file & put this things 

chmod 400 "devops-api-key.pem"
ssh -i "devops-api-key.pem" ubuntu@ec2-xxxxxxx.compute-1.amazonaws.com

after that install nginx 
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install nginx -y

after that

sudo systemctl enable nginx
sudo systemctl start nginx
sudo systemctl status nginx

after tha t in instances copy the address and put that into new tab and paste it ...still not working so 

we have to add some inbound outbound rules 
1. go to instances
2. security,security groups,edit inbound rules,then you can see only have default ssh connect rule,so we need to add new one
 *hhtp> 80 > anywhere ipv4 >server default

after that we need to create ilstic ip for ec2
  1. click ec2 > elastic ip > allocate elastic ip address > us-east-1 > Allocate click
  2. then click elastic ip > associate illastic ip address > give instance > private ip > Do not put tick for reassociation > Associate

after that you need to add new ssh connection to ubuntu and download dependencies.

  sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y 
  sudo apt install nodejs
  node -v
  sudo apt install npm
  npm -v

install mongodb 24 
  curl -fsSL .....
  apt-key list
  echo ....
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install mongodb.org
  mongod --version
  sudo systemctl enable mongod
  start / status 
  mongosh

after that add inbound rule for mongodb and system running port

1.custom tcp > 27017 > Anywhere can IPV4 > mongod server
2.custom tcp > 3000 > Anywhere can IPV4 > server port
